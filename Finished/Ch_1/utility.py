# Example file for Advanced Python: Working With Data by Joe Marini
# demonstrates the use of the any, all, and sum functions
import json


values = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# any() can be used to see if any value in a sequence is True
print(any(values))

# all() will detect if all of the values in a sequence are True
print(all(values))

# sum() can be use to add all of the values in a sequence
print(sum(values))

# these utility functions don't have callbacks like min or max,
# but we can use a generator for more fine control

# open the data file and load the JSON
with open("../../30DayQuakes.json", "r") as datafile:
    data = json.load(datafile)

# are there any quake reports that were felt by more than 25,000 people?
print(any(quake["properties"]["felt"] is not None and quake["properties"]
      ["felt"] > 25000 for quake in data["features"]))

# how many quakes were felt by more than 500 people?
print(sum(quake["properties"]["felt"] is not None and quake["properties"]
      ["felt"] >= 500 for quake in data["features"]))

# how many quakes had a magnitude of 6 or larger?
print(sum(quake["properties"]["mag"] is not None and quake["properties"]
      ["mag"] >= 6 for quake in data["features"]))
