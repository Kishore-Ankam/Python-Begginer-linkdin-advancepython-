# Example file for Advanced Python: Working With Data by Joe Marini
# demonstrates how to serialize data to a CSV file

import csv
import json
import datetime

# read in the contents of the JSON file
with open("../../30DayQuakes.json", "r") as datafile:
    data = json.load(datafile)


def isbig(x):
    mag = x["properties"]["mag"]
    return mag is not None and mag > 5


# Filter the data by quakes that are larger than 5 magnitude
largequakes = list(filter(isbig, data["features"]))

# TODO: Create the header and row structures for the data

# TODO: populate the rows with the resulting quake data

# TODO: write the results to the CSV file
