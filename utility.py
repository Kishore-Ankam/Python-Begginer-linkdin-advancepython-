# Example file for Advanced Python: Working With Data by Joe Marini
# demonstrates the use of the any, all, and sum functions
import json

values = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# TODO: any() can be used to see if any value in a sequence is True


# TODO: all() will detect if all of the values in a sequence are True


# TODO: sum() can be use to add all of the values in a sequence


# these utility functions don't have callbacks like min or max,
# but we can use a generator for more fine control

# open the data file and load the JSON
# with open("../../30DayQuakes.json", "r") as datafile:
#     data = json.load(datafile)

# TODO: are there any quake reports that were felt by more than 25,000 people?


# TODO: how many quakes were felt by more than 500 people?


# TODO: how many quakes had a magnitude of 6 or larger?
